# Changelog - Colonist Buddy

All notable changes to the Colonist Buddy Chrome extension.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-06 üöÄ MAJOR RELEASE

### üéØ **COMPLETE WEBSOCKET MIGRATION**

This is a **ground-up rewrite** of the extension architecture. We've replaced 3600+ lines of fragile DOM parsing with robust, real-time WebSocket message tracking.

### Added

- ‚ú® **WebSocket Message Interception**: Captures all game data directly from server
- ‚ú® **MessagePack Decoding**: Properly decodes Colonist.io's binary protocol
- ‚ú® **Real-Time Game Tracking**: Instant updates as the server sends them
- ‚ú® **Comprehensive Action Handlers**: 
  - Dice rolls (ROLL_DICE, DICE_ROLLED)
  - Building (settlements, cities, roads)
  - Development cards (buy, play Knight, Road Building, etc.)
  - Trading (player trades, bank trades, maritime)
  - Robber actions (move, steal)
  - Discard actions
- ‚ú® **User Detection**: Automatically identifies the extension user
- ‚ú® **Board Layout Extraction**: Captures hex tiles, resources, dice numbers, ports
- ‚ú® **Enhanced Logging**: Beautiful emoji-based console logs for debugging

### Changed

- üîÑ **Architecture**: Complete separation of concerns
  - `websocket-sniffer.js`: Intercepts and decodes WebSocket messages
  - `websocket-game-tracker.js`: Processes messages and manages game state
  - `content-ui.js`: Pure UI rendering (no game logic)
- üîÑ **manifest.json**: Updated to v3.0.0, reflects WebSocket architecture
- üîÑ **File Structure**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### Removed

- ‚ùå **DOM Parsing Logic**: All 3000+ lines of fragile text parsing
- ‚ùå **MutationObserver**: No longer needed, WebSocket provides updates
- ‚ùå **Regex Patterns**: No more brittle pattern matching
- ‚ùå **DOM Selectors**: No more `.querySelector()` hell
- ‚ùå **Game Log Parsing**: No more reading HTML elements
- ‚ùå **Trade Parser**: Replaced by WebSocket trade messages
- ‚ùå **Resource Gain Parser**: Replaced by WebSocket resource updates
- ‚ùå **Build Action Parser**: Replaced by WebSocket build messages
- ‚ùå **Dev Card Parser**: Replaced by WebSocket card messages

### Fixed

- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: 100% accurate data from server (no more guessing)
- ‚úÖ **Timing Issues**: Real-time updates, no delays or missed actions
- ‚úÖ **Impossible States**: No more state conflicts or contradictions
- ‚úÖ **Resource Counting**: Exact counts from server, not estimates
- ‚úÖ **Multi-language Support**: Works regardless of game language (no text parsing)
- ‚úÖ **UI Changes**: No longer breaks when Colonist.io updates their DOM

### Technical Details

**Old Architecture (v1.x - v2.x)**:
```
Game ‚Üí DOM Updates ‚Üí Extension Polls DOM ‚Üí Parses HTML/Text ‚Üí Updates State
                      ‚Üë Breaks easily with UI changes
```

**New Architecture (v3.0.0)**:
```
Game ‚Üí Server WebSocket ‚Üí Extension Intercepts ‚Üí Decodes MessagePack ‚Üí Updates State
                           ‚Üë Robust and future-proof
```

**Code Reduction**:
- Before: ~3600 lines (content.js)
- After: ~800 lines total (websocket-sniffer.js + websocket-game-tracker.js + content-ui.js)
- **78% less code**, 10x more maintainable

### Breaking Changes

- üî• Old `content.js` replaced with `content-ui.js`
- üî• All DOM parsing functions removed
- üî• State structure simplified (no more `possibleStates` array)
- üî• Extension now requires page to establish WebSocket connection

### Migration Guide

If you were using v2.x:
1. Uninstall old version
2. Install v3.0.0
3. Reload colonist.io page
4. Extension will auto-initialize with new WebSocket tracking

No user data is lost (table positions preserved in localStorage).
