## ‚úÖ Real Game Test (colonist.io)

### Part 1: Loading
- [ ] Go to https://colonist.io
- [ ] Open DevTools Console (`F12` or `Cmd+Option+J` on Mac)

  ```
  Colonist Card Counter extension loaded

  ```

- [ ] Console should be relatively quiet (not spamming messages)

### Part 2: Game Detection
- [ ] Click "Play" and either:
  - Join an existing game, OR
  - Create a new game
- [ ] Once in game lobby, watch console
- [ ] Should see one of:
  - `‚úÖ Game started! Found container on retry!` (if game log is visible)
  - `[Observer] Still waiting for game to start...` (every 15 seconds, normal)

### Part 3: In-Game Functionality
**Start or join an actual game:**

- [ ] Game has started (you can see the board)
- [ ] Look at the **right side** of the screen
- [ ] Two tables should appear:
  
  **Dice Statistics Table:**

  - [ ] Shows "0%" or actual percentages
  - [ ] Updates when dice are rolled
  
  **Resource Tracking Table:**
  - [ ] Shows player names with colors
  - [ ] Shows 5 resource columns (wood, brick, sheep, wheat, ore)
  - [ ] Shows "Total" column
  - [ ] Initially shows zeros

### Part 4: Live Tracking
**Play a few rounds and verify:**

- [ ] When dice are rolled:
  - [ ] Dice table updates with new roll
  - [ ] Percentages recalculate
  
- [ ] When resources are gained:
  - [ ] Resource numbers increase for correct players
  - [ ] Cells briefly highlight yellow
  
- [ ] When buildings are placed:
  - [ ] Resource counts decrease
  
- [ ] When trades happen:
  - [ ] Both players' resources update accordingly

### Part 5: Console Health Check
- [ ] Console should NOT be spamming messages
- [ ] Should NOT see repeated errors
- [ ] May see occasional game actions being logged (normal)
- [ ] Should NOT see "Impossible state detected" frequently

## üêõ Common Issues and Quick Fixes

### Issue: Extension not in extension list
**Fix:** Make sure you selected the correct folder containing `manifest.json`

### Issue: "Errors" button appears
**Fix:** Click it and read the error. Usually means a file is missing or syntax error.

### Issue: Console spam with "‚ùå No game log container found"
**Fix:** This is NORMAL if you're NOT in an active game. The extension is waiting for you to start playing.

### Issue: Tables don't appear
**Fix:** 
1. Hard refresh the page: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Win) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Make sure you're IN a game, not just in the lobby
3. Check console for errors
4. Try reloading the extension

### Issue: Tables appear but don't update
**Fix:**
1. Check if game log is visible on the page
2. Make sure dice are actually being rolled
3. Look for error messages in console
4. The extension may need a few seconds to detect game start

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

If you can check ALL of these, your extension is working perfectly:

- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Test page shows all green checkmarks
- [ ] Console shows extension initialized
- [ ] Tables appear when game starts
- [ ] Dice statistics update on rolls
- [ ] Resource counts update on resource gain
- [ ] No console spam or repeated errors

## üéâ Success!

If everything above works, congratulations! Your extension is properly installed and functioning.
